Pathfinding algorithm pseudocode:

def existsPath(self,start,end):

current_pos = start_pos
checked_pos = []
options = []
while True:
	for the four surrounding points of current_pos:
		if the point is the destination:
			return True
		elif point is a railroad and point not in checked_pos and there's not a piece on it:
			options.append(point)
	if len(options) >= 1:
		checked_pos.append(current_pos)
		current_pos = options.pop(0)
	else:
		return False


Controller class layout:
class Play
	initializes board and states
		randomizes first to move
	handles all game logic
	takes care of winning, losing, and revealing
	delay when switching turns
